\subsubsection*{Soul}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Differentiate between playable characters and NPCs (why?
        so NPCs can have an AI module, drop-treasure module, boss,
        etc., but are ultimately the same)
    \item Implement a system where one soul can attack another soul.
\end{enumerate}
