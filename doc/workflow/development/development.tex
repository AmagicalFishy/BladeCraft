\begin{itemize}
    \item Keep a specific goal in mind 
    \item Start from the beginning and work towards the end
\end{itemize}

\hline

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Differentiate between playable characters and NPCs (why?
        so NPCs can have an AI module, drop-treasure module, boss,
        etc., but are ultimately the same)
    \item Implement a system where one soul can attack another soul. \checkmark
    \item Implement Soul death
    \item Create a good damage/defense formula (for use with abilities!)
    \item Implement items / equippables (using composition) \checkmark
    \item Implement inventory system \checkmark
    \item \sout{Look into event handling for keyboard presses}
    \item \sout{Rewrite linked list implementation for rooms as STL compatible}
    \item Implement rooms \checkmark
    \item Implement item notifier/handler \checkmark
    \item Implement information modules for rooms, items, and characters \checkmark
    \item Add some kind of sensible item-hierarchy system \checkmark
    \item Fix item system \checkmark
    \item Flesh out the slots for equipping something
    \item Implement actual game loop
    \item Implement command system
    \item Improve the "get" system so it can take adjectives. This 
        probably implies improving the InfoModule aswell.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Details}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Un-protect ``equipment" in item.cpp
    \item Prevent soul from targetting itself
    \item Prevent notifier from notifying if registered listeners is empty
    \item Prevent item from being equipped by more than one soul
    \item Implement max-size for inventory
    \item Ensure no new keys can be added in any of the maps
    \item Ensure no two items can be picked up by the same Soul
    \item Add a nullptr check for linked rooms. Respond with something
        like ``You can't move in this direction!" \checkmark
    \item Error-catching for items dropped that are not in the inventory
    \item Items and souls \textbf{have} to be in a room. \checkmark
    \item Ensure rooms, items, and souls are initialized so that seg
        fault doesn't occur when soul enters room that doesn't have
        info
    \item Make everything const
    \item Organize members alphabetically (or some other way that
        makes sense)
\end{enumerate}
