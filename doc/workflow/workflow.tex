\subsection*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make a MUD

\subsection*{Descriptions}
\textbf{Item:} Has data members durability, weight, weight-distribution, flexibility, 

\subsubsection*{Forward Declared Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Info:} Contains external description of item. This
    includes how it looks, size, and volume-type. Size and volume type
    factor into what said item can fit into and weight distribution.  
    Also contains unique ID and name.

    \item \textbf{Material:} Contains information regarding the
    material of the item. This factors primarily into things like
    durability, weight, density, and flexibility. 

    \item \textbf{Enhancements:} Contains information regarding how
    this item affects the statistics of the one who posesses it or the
    one it's used on.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Child Classes (Dependants in which `Item' is Included)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Weapon:} Has data members damage-type.

    \item \textbf{Clothing:} Has data members defense, 
        wearable-locations.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Possible Commands} \subsubsection*{Weaponry} jab, light
swing, medium swing, heavy swing, parry, guard, special

\subsubsection*{Clothing} wear

\subsection*{Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combat like Vindictus/PSO. It needs to be \textit{that} good.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Step forward when swing (using attacks as movement)
            \item Fast-paced
        \end{itemize}
    \item Environment/tiles/depth like MineCraft
    \item Graphics like Final Fantasy Tactics (maybe taller)
    \item Card Game like FF8 or FF9
    \item A primary tower-dungeon like Sword Art Online (but with a 
        whole world built around it; it doesn't consist of just the
        tower-dungeon).
    \item Play some .Hack and see how that combat is.
    \item No one can see each other's level, equipment, etc.  
        explicitely (only how it looks, how strong a person is, etc.)
    \item NEURO: Concentrate for special attack. Black and white.  
        Soothing voice: "Breath..." Everything around silences.


\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Game Engine Logic}
\subsubsection*{Attack}
\begin{tikzcd}
    \text{Soul::attack()} \ar[r, "1"] & \text{world::process()} &
    \text{Soul::defend()} \ar [l, "2"]\\
    \text{abilities and buffs} \ar[ur, "1"]
\end{tikzcd}
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Soul has member `target' and member object `stats'.  
        References to these members are sent to the world, along with 
        desired ability. Target is const reference to target.

    \item World checks, first, to see if the ability is in Soul's
        ability list. If so, it applies ability's damage modifiers.

    \item World calculates 'pure damage' using soul1 stuff. It calculates "pure defense" 

\end{enumerate}
